Slide 3: Lexicon Strategy Overview
Objective:

Automatically flag potential complaint emails using predefined keywords/sentiment rules (e.g., “refund,” “broken,” “unacceptable”).

Generate a dataset for research team validation against system-logged complaints.

Methodology:

Lexicon Development: Curated list of 100+ complaint-related keywords/phrases.

Rule-Based Filtering: Emails tagged if they contain ≥1 high-priority keyword or ≥2 medium-priority keywords.

Data Export: Flagged emails compiled for research team analysis.

Why Lexicon First?

Simple, transparent baseline for future AI/ML models.

Easily adjustable rules based on feedback.

Slide 4: 6-Week Data Snapshot
Key Metrics:

Total Emails Analyzed: 5,000

Flagged as Potential Complaints: 750 (15%)

Top Complaint Categories:

Billing Issues: 40%

Product Defects: 30%

Service Delays: 20%

Other: 10%

Accuracy Metrics (Sampled):

Precision: 70% (70% of flagged emails were actual complaints).

Recall: 65% (35% of true complaints missed by lexicon).

False Positives: 30% (e.g., “I had a problem scheduling a call” ≠ complaint).

Visual: Bar chart comparing flagged vs. actual complaints.

Slide 5: Validation Process with Research Team
Objective:

Compare lexicon-flagged emails with complaints already logged in the system.

Identify gaps (false positives/negatives) to refine rules.

Steps for Validation:

Data Matching:

Research team cross-references flagged emails (750) with system-submitted complaints.

Example: If 500 complaints were logged in the system, how many overlapped with lexicon results?

Root-Cause Analysis:

Why were some complaints missed? (e.g., lexicon gaps, ambiguous language).

Why were non-complaints flagged? (e.g., keyword misuse).

Actionable Feedback:

Update lexicon with new keywords (e.g., “escalate,” “compensation”).

Add context rules (e.g., “problem” + “refund” = complaint).

Slide 6: Sample Discrepancies Identified
Case 1: False Negative

Email: “Your service is unacceptable. I need a resolution ASAP.”

Missed Reason: “Unacceptable” not in lexicon.

Case 2: False Positive

Email: “I had a problem scheduling a demo, but it’s resolved now.”

Flagged Reason: Keyword “problem” triggered false alert.

Visual: Side-by-side email snippets with annotations.

Slide 7: Next Steps for Validation
Handoff to Research Team:

Deliver flagged email dataset (750) with metadata (date, sender, category).

Provide access to system complaint logs for comparison.

Collaboration Framework:

Weekly syncs to review discrepancies.

Joint refinement of lexicon rules based on findings.

Timeline:

Week 1: Data transfer and alignment.

Week 2-3: Analysis and feedback sessions.

Week 4: Finalize updated lexicon rules.

Slide 8: Expected Outcomes Post-Validation
Improved Precision/Recall: Target ≥85% precision, ≥80% recall.

Actionable Insights:

Identify recurring complaint themes for proactive resolution.

Refine keyword list to reduce manual triage effort.

Foundation for Automation: Prep for integration with AI tools (e.g., sentiment analysis).

Slide 9: Roadmap
Phase 1 (Done): Lexicon development & 6-week analysis.

Phase 2 (Now): Research team validation (4 weeks).

Phase 3 (Next): Pilot refined rules + measure impact.

Design Tips:
Use comparative visuals:

Venn diagram showing overlap between lexicon-flagged and system-logged complaints.

Heatmap of top complaint categories.

Include before/after examples of lexicon improvements.

Add icons for collaboration (e.g., handshake for teamwork, magnifying glass for analysis).

This structure ensures stakeholders understand the purpose of the 6-week data, how the research team will validate it, and the long-term value of refining the strategy. Let me know if you need help creating specific visuals or expanding sections!
