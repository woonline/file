Slide 3: Lexicon Strategy Overview
Objective:

Automatically flag potential complaint emails using predefined keywords/sentiment rules (e.g., “refund,” “broken,” “unacceptable”).

Generate a dataset for research team validation against system-logged complaints.

Methodology:

Lexicon Development: Curated list of 100+ complaint-related keywords/phrases.

Rule-Based Filtering: Emails tagged if they contain ≥1 high-priority keyword or ≥2 medium-priority keywords.

Data Export: Flagged emails compiled for research team analysis.

Why Lexicon First?

Simple, transparent baseline for future AI/ML models.

Easily adjustable rules based on feedback.

Slide 4: 6-Week Data Snapshot
Slide 4: 6-Week Data Snapshot
Objective: Share raw results of lexicon-based flagging for research team validation.

Key Metrics:

Total Inbound Emails: [X] (e.g., 5,000)

Flagged as Potential Complaints: [Y] (e.g., 750 | 15% of total)

Breakdown of Flagged Emails by Category:

Billing Issues: [A%]

Product Defects: [B%]

Service Delays: [C%]

Other: [D%]

Visual:

Bar Chart 1: Total emails vs. flagged complaints.

Pie Chart: Distribution of complaint categories.

Key Observations:

Lexon rules flagged 15% of total emails as potential complaints.

Top category: Billing Issues (40% of flagged emails).

Slide 5: Next Steps – Research Team Validation & Feedback
Objective: Validate flagged emails against system-logged complaints and refine lexicon rules.

Process:

Data Handoff to Research Team:

Provide 6 weeks of flagged emails (750) with metadata (date, sender, keywords).

Share system complaint logs for the same period.

Validation Tasks for Research Team:

Step 1: Compare flagged emails with system-logged complaints.

Are flagged emails actually complaints?

Are system-logged complaints missed by the lexicon?

Step 2: Categorize discrepancies:

False Positives: Flagged emails that are not complaints (e.g., “problem” used neutrally).

False Negatives: Complaints in the system not flagged by the lexicon.

Feedback Sessions:

Joint workshops to review findings.

Refine lexicon rules to:

Reduce False Positives: Remove/contextualize ambiguous keywords.

Improve Coverage: Add missing complaint phrases (e.g., “escalate,” “compensation”).

Expected Outcomes:

Sharper Lexicon Rules: Reduce alert volume by [X%].

Actionable Insights: Prioritize high-impact complaint categories (e.g., billing).

Timeline:

Week 1: Data handoff and alignment.

Week 2-3: Research team analysis.

Week 4: Feedback and rule refinement.

Visual:

Process Flow Diagram: Data handoff → validation → feedback → refinement.

Example Snippets: Show 1–2 anonymized false positive/negative emails.

Key Adjustments Based on Your Feedback:
Slide 4 now purely focuses on volumes and categories (no precision/recall metrics).

Slide 5 emphasizes the collaboration with the research team, framing validation as the critical next step to refine rules and reduce noise.

Added concrete examples of how false positives/negatives will be addressed.

Lexicon-Based Complaint Identification: A Simple Explanation
Lexicon-based complaint identification is a rule-driven method to automatically detect potential complaints in text (like emails) using a predefined list of keywords, phrases, or sentiment markers (a "lexicon"). It’s like creating a "filter" to catch emails that might contain complaints based on specific words or patterns.

How It Works
Build a Lexicon (Keyword List):

Curate a list of words/phrases commonly associated with complaints (e.g., “refund,” “broken,” “unhappy,” “not working”).

Example:

High-priority terms: "demand a refund," "terrible service"

Medium-priority terms: "issue," "disappointed"

Scan Inbound Emails:

Automatically flag emails that contain ≥1 high-priority term or ≥2 medium-priority terms.

Tag and Export:

Emails meeting the criteria are tagged as “potential complaints” and compiled for further review.

Why Use a Lexicon-Based Approach?
Simplicity: Easy to set up and explain (no complex AI models).

Transparency: Rules are clear and adjustable (e.g., add/remove keywords).

Baseline for Improvement: Provides a starting point to later train AI/ML models.

Speed: Processes large email volumes quickly.

Example in Action
Email 1:
“My order arrived broken. I demand a refund immediately!”

Triggered Keywords: “broken,” “demand a refund”

Result: Flagged as a complaint.

Email 2:
“I had a problem logging in, but it’s fixed now.”

Triggered Keyword: “problem”

Result: Flagged as a false positive (not a complaint).

Limitations & Challenges
False Positives:

Non-complaint emails with keywords (e.g., “I had a problem scheduling a call” ≠ complaint).

False Negatives:

Complaints that lack lexicon terms (e.g., “This is unacceptable”).

Context Ignored:

Sarcasm, slang, or nuanced language may be missed.

How Validation by the Research Team Helps
The 6-week flagged email data will be cross-checked by the research team to:

Identify Gaps:

“Why did the lexicon miss this complaint?” → Add missing keywords.

Reduce Noise:

“Why was this email falsely flagged?” → Remove ambiguous terms.

Refine Rules:

Combine keywords with context (e.g., “problem” + “refund” = complaint).

Key Takeaway
Lexicon-based identification is a foundational step to:

Quickly filter potential complaints at scale.

Generate data for deeper analysis and future automation (e.g., AI).

Prioritize improvements based on real-world feedback.
